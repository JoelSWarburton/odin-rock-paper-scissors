# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is the first javascript project in the odin project. 

This project was initial written to be played in the console. It has since been
modified to be played via a GUI. 

## Things I learned from this project:

- Deepened my understanding of functions, and in my research what callback functions
are and how they are helpful.
- How to manipulate the DOM in various ways.
- Learned to use ESLint as a tool to help find and fix problems with JS code.


The live version of the project can be found [here.](https://joelswarburton.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/)
